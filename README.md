# Lorenz_Attractor
Matlab/Octave code to simulate a Lorenz System
The Lorenz Attractor is a system of three ordinary differential equations.
The constant parameters for the system are sigma, rho and beta (which can be edited in the main file).
The initial conditions for the system are also given in the same file.
